					<h1>FAMILY</h1>
					<p class="aboutme1">
						We are a close-knit group of individuals who share a special bond of love and togetherness. Our family is made up of mom, dad, and three amazing kids. We live, laugh, and learn together, cherishing every moment we spend as a family.

						In our little corner of the web, we want to share the joy, challenges, and adventures that come with being a family. From our fun-filled outings to our cozy evenings at home, we hope to give you a glimpse into our world. We believe that family is where life begins and love never ends, and we invite you to join us on our journey of love, growth, and happiness. So, come on in, get to know us, and become a part of our online family too!

					<h1>INFORMATION MANAGEMENT</h1>
					<p class="aboutme1">
						My expectation for this subject is to learn how to use databases so that I can become really good at it and fully understand how they work. I also hope to have fun during our discussions and get a lot of practice in coding. 
						<br><br>
						five years from now, I hope I'll be, pretty good at this database stuff. Maybe I'll be working in a nice job where I help a company keep all their important info in order. Like, making sure they don't lose anything and can find stuff super easily. That would be pretty awesome, for now, I'm just trying to learn the basics and figure out how all this database stuff works.
